# SQL Injection

## 0X00 Basic Idea

[SQL injection][3] is a very common attack method.

User inputs are executed in database directly.

1. Variables under user control
2. Variables executed in database

## 0x01 Labs

- [Lab1 Access Cookie Injection](./lab1_access_cookie_injection)
- [Lab2 Access Offset Injection](./lab2_access_offset_injection)
- [Lab3 MySQL Error-Based Injection](./lab3_mysql_error_based_injection)
- [Lab4 MySQL DNS Injection](./lab4_mysql_dns_injection)

## 0x02 Cookie Injection

To avoid some of the input firewall with [ModHeader][1] or manually write

```js
document.cookie = "xxx";
```

The processes are pretty much same as injecting via url. Only need to replace **SPACE ' '** with **PLUS '+'**. 

## 0x03 MD5

Try decode MD5 from online tools such as [CMD5][2]
