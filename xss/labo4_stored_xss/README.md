# Open Lab 4 Stored XSS

## 0x00 Basic Knowledge

Stored XSS is a type of attack that end users can write and store js codes on a website. All other users visiting the site will run the injected code.

And the most import thing XSS can get is Cookie, which can used for login to the system. So normally we may need help from XSS platforms ([xsspt.com][3], [xss.tf][4]).
