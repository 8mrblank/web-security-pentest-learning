# File Upload Issues

## 0x00 General Overview

There are generally two types of verification to check the uploaded file. Client/Browser side and server side verification.

Client side verification is not very reliable because it is very easy to bypass JS code by catching packages. Sometimes it is also as easy as disabling the JS. And normally they only check file extensions with black/white list.

For server side verfication, it may also go check file Content-Type. So we may need to attach the shell code to a real image.
