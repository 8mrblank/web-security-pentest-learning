## 0x00 Basic Concepts

[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)][2] is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request.
